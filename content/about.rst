NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source
scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly
successful ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for
their community to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an
umbrella organization which removes the burden from the projects
themselves to raise money.

Money donated through NumFOCUS goes to sponsor things like:

-  Coding sprints (food and travel)
-  Technical fellowships (sponsored students and mentors to work on
   code)
-  Equipment grants (to developers and projects)
-  Conference attendance for students (to PyData, SciPy, and other
   conferences)
-  Fees for continuous integration and other software engineering tools
-  Documentation development
-  Web-page hosting and bandwidth fees for projects

NumFOCUS aims to ensure that money is available to keep projects in the
scientific Python stack funded and available. So if you find value in
these tools and have always wanted to give back, donating to NumFOCUS
gives you a way of supporting either a specific project of your choice
or all of these great codes at once!

-  NumFOCUS has received 501(c)3 status as a public charity in the
   United States.

There are many ways to give. We have tried to make it as simple as
possible to donate to NumFOCUS.  Please see the links at the bottom of the
