We would like to thank JP Morgan for their generosity and continued support of
our educational efforts. These funds, in addition to sponsorship of PyData,
support our Women in Technology Initiatives, and will also provide the funding
needed to kick off the John Hunter Technical Fellowship.

Our Women in Technology Initiatives have included: the Women in Science and
Education (WiSE) Bootcamp in Boston and The Women in Technology (WiT) Workshop
at PyData. We are in the process of working with our bootcamp partner, 
`Software Carpentry`_, on an upcoming event in Oakland.

Watch for information coming soon on our first John Hunter Technical
Fellowship.
