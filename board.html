<p>Emmanuelle Gouillart works as a physics researcher in the joint laboratory
between the French National Research Center (<span class="caps">CNRS</span>), and the French corporation
Saint-Gobain. She holds a physics PhD from the Université Pierre et Marie
Curie, and an MSc from the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Her research
interests are in glass melting, tomography imaging, and fluid mixing.
Scientific Python is the ubiquitous tool in her daily&nbsp;research.</p>
<p>She became involved in the Scientific Python community with the Numpy/Scipy
documentation marathon from 2008 on, and shortly after she started teaching
Scientific Python during the Python African Tour event in Dakar in 2009. She
has been contributing to the Scipy Lecture Notes used for the Euroscipy
tutorial sessions since Euroscipy 2010, where she was tutorial chair, and she
has organized several training sessions on Scientific Python since then. She
has been part of the organizing board of the Euroscipy conferences in 2010,
2011 and 2012. Her daily use of image processing has led her to become a
regular contributor to the Python&nbsp;scikit-image.</p>

<h3>Perry&nbsp;Greenfield</h3>
<img alt="Perry Greenfield" src="static/images/perry-greenfield.jpg" style="height: 150px;" />
<p>Perry Greenfield received a Ph.D. in Physics from <span class="caps">M.I.T.</span> His thesis was based
on Very Large Array radio observations of the first discovered gravitational
lens. After a short stint in communications engineering at Bell Labs, he ended
up at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where he has worked for the last
26 years. He initially was responsible for calibrating the Faint Object Camera
for the Hubble Space Telescope, but for the last 16 years he has been
leading the Science Software Branch. He has pioneered the use of Python in
astronomy, and his group has been heavily involved in Python for the last 12
years. They have developed PyRAF, numarray (the precursor to current NumPy
capabilities), PyFITS, and been heavily involved in the development and
support of matplotlib. His group is now heavily involved in developing the
science software to support the next large space telescope under
construction, the James Webb Space&nbsp;Telescope.</p>

founding author of the SciPy package. During his academic career, he has worked
in the fields of satellite remote sensing, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (<span class="caps">MRI</span>),
Ultrasound, elastography, and general inverse&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>He was an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Brigham
Young University from 2001 to 2007 where he taught courses in probability
theory, electromagnetics, inverse problems, and signal processing. In addition,
he directed the <span class="caps">BYU</span> Biomedical Imaging Lab, and performed research on scanning
impedance imaging. He has done consulting work since 1997 in laser scattering
off of semiconductors, sparse matrix calculations for search engines, and mesh
transformations for fluid&nbsp;dynamics.</p>
<p>Dr. Oliphant served as President of Enthought from 2007 until 2011, where he
oversaw the establishment of additional satellite offices in New York City,
Belgium, Cambridge <span class="caps">UK</span>, and Mumbai, India. During this time, he worked with
Fortune 50 companies such as Shell, <span class="caps">J.P.</span> Morgan, and Proctor and Gamble in all

computing. He started the open source IPython project in 2001 when he needed an
efficient interactive workflow for everyday scientific tasks. He continues to
lead IPython, as part of a growing team of talented developers.  He remains
committed to the development of open, high-level tools to tackle the current
challenges in computationally-based scientific research and education across
disciplines. He is a member of the matplotlib development team and has
contributed to numpy, scipy, sympy, mayavi, nipy and nitime. He regularly
organizes workshops and lectures aimed at teaching the use of these tools to
