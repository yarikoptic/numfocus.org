&lt;h2&gt;Becoming a Member of&amp;nbsp;NumFOCUS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the NumFOCUS Foundation was formed to &amp;#8220;promote the use of
accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology.&amp;#8221; Much
of this effort centers around the use of Python and it’s&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NumFOCUS is excited to announce membership is now open. The involvement of the
community is vital in helping to help raise the visibility of Python and its
advantages within the scientific and engineering community, as well as to
support and promote its&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of the numerous ways members can become involved&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining committees and teams formed to help further the goals of&amp;nbsp;NumFOCUS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping to build a system to keep track of scientific and engineering
publications making significant use of Python, while helping to document its
importance in these&amp;nbsp;fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advocating the use of Python by recording and publicizing success stories of
researchers and companies who use&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitating events at conferences, workshops, and sprints that educate
attendees regarding the advantages of using Python in technical&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping with the selection of individuals and organizations to receive
financial support for conferences, workshops, and&amp;nbsp;fellowships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggesting and assisting in the formation of&amp;nbsp;committees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other advantages of membership&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source
scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly
successful ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for
their community to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an
umbrella organization which removes the burden from the projects
themselves to raise&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money donated through NumFOCUS goes to sponsor things&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding sprints (food and&amp;nbsp;travel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical fellowships (sponsored students and mentors to work on&amp;nbsp;code)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equipment grants (to developers and&amp;nbsp;projects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference attendance for students (to PyData, SciPy, and other&amp;nbsp;conferences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fees for continuous integration and other software engineering&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&amp;nbsp;development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web-page hosting and bandwidth fees for&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NumFOCUS aims to ensure that money is available to keep projects in the
scientific Python stack funded and available. So if you find value in
these tools and have always wanted to give back, donating to NumFOCUS
gives you a way of supporting either a specific project of your choice
or all of these great codes at&amp;nbsp;once!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NumFOCUS has received 501(c)3 status as a public charity in the
United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to give. We have tried to make it as simple as
possible to donate to NumFOCUS. You can use any of the following payment&amp;nbsp;providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PayPal&lt;/strong&gt; -&amp;nbsp;(2.90% + $0.30 /&amp;nbsp;transaction)&lt;/p&gt;
