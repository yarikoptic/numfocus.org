<h3>Treasurer’s&nbsp;Report</h3>
<p>SciPy’13 has been officially sponsored, funds for this were disbursed
($2500). &nbsp;This gives Numfocus a silver sponsor level (2 passes, booth,
name on website). &nbsp;Once the corresponding details for EuroScipy are
clear, the same will be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>Old&nbsp;Business</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>&nbsp;Mac Mini - Is this ready to be publicized on the&nbsp;site?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ralf reports that Christoph hasn’t replied much to his queries. &nbsp;The
site is up and a NumPy <span class="caps">CI</span> engine is set up, but he’s waiting for
responses from Christoph. &nbsp;Anthony suggests asking the list for help so
that someone can support&nbsp;Christoph.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>&nbsp;Fundraising for Boot Camp for Women in Science and&nbsp;Engineering</li>
</ol>
<p>Work is ongoing with a funder to secure the majority of the cost. &nbsp;More
follow-up is&nbsp;needed.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li>Sponsorship of SciPy and&nbsp;passes</li>
</ol>
<p>Our donations are earmarked for student support, we get two
session/tutorial passes at the silver sponsor level (see Treasurer’s
report for&nbsp;details).</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="4">
<li>&nbsp;SciPy domains ready to&nbsp;transfer</li>
</ol>
<p>Travis checked that all domains have been transferred. &nbsp;We will wait for
the person working on SciPy central before pointing the domains over to
a new&nbsp;site.</p>
<div class="section" id="team-reports">
<h4>Team&nbsp;Reports</h4>
<p><strong>Membership:</strong> we are considering opening up the membership model to
one where the basic level is free for anyone to join, and the
paying/participating membership levels have some benefits as well. &nbsp;We
will draft some language on this topic in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising:</strong>&nbsp;Ralf and Andy proposed updating the language on the
Technical Fellowship to: “Purpose (new formulation): The purpose of the
NumFOCUS Technology Fellowship Program is to enable high-potential
graduate students and early career professionals to work full-time on
cutting-edge scientific open source&nbsp;software.”</p>
<p>“Target areas: infrastructure for SciPy eco-system, accessible and
reproducible computing (&amp; core&nbsp;projects?</p>
<p>Travis likes the intent. Keeping the educational component in mind is&nbsp;important.</p>
<p><strong>Publicity/Promotion:</strong> Andy manned the booth at PyCon along with Leah
and Anthony. &nbsp;Lots of contacts were made, there was good interest and a
number of people came by with the idea of doing “bounties” on specific
topics. &nbsp;Some people didn’t like the nomination model for membership.
&nbsp;Talked to the Center for Open Science, a new venture at the University
of Virginia (<a class="reference external" href="http://centerforopenscience.org/">http://centerforopenscience.org</a>) whose goals are very
well aligned with NumFOCUS. &nbsp;Anthony also talked to the “Data science
for social good” group in Chicago, which has an explicit education and
open government/open science mission; they have a 10-week summer
fellowship program we can learn&nbsp;from.</p>

<p>The Disco authors have left Nokia and would like to have numfocus to
hold that domain as well as their trademark and all other <span class="caps">IP</span> associated
with the project. &nbsp;They are waiting to see our domain transfer form.
&nbsp;Anthony asked about what legal responsibilities we’d be exposed to in

<p>d. &nbsp;Industry funding for IPython - contract issues. Conversation with
Brad Kuhn from the Software Conservancy. &nbsp;Fernando will set up a
conversation with Brad Kuhn and any board members who are interested in
participating, to clarify some of the legal issues involved. The <span class="caps">SWC</span> has
experience with this and Brad offered to provide some information to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;PyData Vimeo Channel - $150 to $200. The motion for these funds was&nbsp;approved.</p>
